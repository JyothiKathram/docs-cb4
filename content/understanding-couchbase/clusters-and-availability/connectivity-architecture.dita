    Client to Cluster
   </title> 
   
   <p>
    Client applications communicate with Couchbase Server through a set of server-defined access-points,
    each of which provides ports for both clear and encrypted communication. 
   </p>
   
   <p> 
    The five principal access-points are as follows:

   Cluster-nodes intercommunicate in order to
   replicate data, maintain indexes, check health of nodes, communicate changes to the
   cluster-configuration, and more. See

    Couchbase Server clusters communicate
    with one other by means of <i>Cross Datacenter Replication</i> (XDCR). See

    Cluster to External Connector 
   </title> 
   
   <p>
   Couchbase Server also communicates with third party products, using <i>connectors</i>.
   Support is provided for Elasticsearch, Hadoop, Kafka, Spark, and Talend. Drivers
   are provided for ODBC and JDBC.
   See
   <xref href="../../connectors/intro.dita" scope="local" format="dita"></xref>, for
    detailed information.

    Connectivity Phases
   </title>
   
   <p>
    Client connectivity is established in three phases: <i>authentication and authorization</i>, <i>discovery</i>, and 
    <i>service connection</i>.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    
   </p>
    
    <ol>
     
    <li>
     <i>Authentication and Authorization</i>: The client authenticates with <i>username</i> and <i>password</i>. If
     these are associated with a Couchbase-Server defined <i>role</i>, itself associated with appropriate
     privileges on the resources access to which is being attempted, the client is authorized. Otherwise,
     access is refused. See
     <xref href="../../security/security-authorization.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Authorization</xref>
     for details.
     
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
     
    <li>
     <i>Discovery</i>: A cluster map is returned to the client. This indicates the current
     cluster-topology; including the list of nodes, the data-distribution across the nodes, and
     the service-distribution accross the nodes.
     
     <p>
      
     </p>
    </li>
     
    <li>
     <i>Service Connection</i>: Once in possession of the cluster map, the client determines the 
     connections needed to establish and perform service-level operations. Additional
     authorizations may be required, depending on the operations attempting. Note that in the event of
     topology-changes, a service connection may receive an exception; in which case discovery
     can be re-run, and operations retried with new connections.
